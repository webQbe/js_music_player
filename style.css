    /* Syntax Breakdown:

        linear-gradient: Specifies a gradient that changes color along a straight line.

        0deg: Determines the direction of the gradient. 

            0deg: Starts the gradient from the bottom of the element and moves upwards.
            90deg: Moves from the left side to the right.
            180deg: Starts from the top and moves downwards.
            -90deg: Moves from the right side to the left.

        rgb(247, 247, 247): The first color, a very light gray.

        23.8%: Specifies where this color ends in the gradient. The light gray color will dominate the first 23.8% of the gradient's length.

        rgb(252, 221, 221): The second color, a pink.

        92%: Specifies where this color reaches full dominance, starting to blend in earlier. Between 23.8% and 92%, the gradient gradually transitions from light gray to pink.

        Visual Effect:

            The gradient starts at the bottom with a light gray (rgb(247, 247, 247)).

            By 23.8% of the way up, the light gray reaches full opacity and begins transitioning.

            Between 23.8% and 92% of the element's height, the gradient smoothly transitions to pink (rgb(252, 221, 221).

            The pink color dominates fully from 92% to the top of the element. */
